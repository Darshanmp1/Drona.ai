# Main dependency for generating text embeddings
# This is a lightweight library that provides pre-trained models
sentence-transformers==2.2.2

# Required for numerical operations and vector math
# The vector store uses this for similarity calculations
numpy==1.24.3

# These come with sentence-transformers but listing for clarity:
